# Configure PiAware

In order to start PiAware, you need to register with Flight Aware and request a Feed ID. There are directions on how to do that [here](https://github.com/mikenye/docker-piaware#new-to-piaware).

Copy the **env-example** file to **.env**. Edit the **.env** file to include the correct values.
